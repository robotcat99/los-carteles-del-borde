   <description>Derived from the Los Carteles Del Borde mod from velcroboy333, I was very impressed by the loot crate system that they had made, which as far as I can tell has yet to be replicated elsewhere. This update expands the drugs that are available and is extensively patched with interconnectivity in mind, including popular mods such as Combat Extended.</description>
